NOTE: if you have not already setup this project, i would recommend waiting a few days. i will be pushing a number of changes that are partially backwards incompatible and the new version should be a bit easier to use!

Roborock Local Server is a private Roborock HTTPS and MQTT stack you run on your own system.

This service is meant to stay private. Point your own DNS at your server's LAN IP and do **NOT** expose it directly to the public internet. In its current state it does not handle internet exposure safely enough. For now, keep it on your LAN only. In the future, I plan to reuse Roborock's auth natively which should make everything secure enough.

This project is in VERY EARLY BETA!!! Do not use this repository unless you are sure you know what you are doing and are rather technical.

## Requirements

- a domain you control
- a place to run the stack on your LAN
- either Docker Compose or a Home Assistant installation that supports add-ons
- a second machine for onboarding later
- a Cloudflare API token with DNS edit access for the zone if you want automatic certificate renewal

## Getting Started

Start here if this is your first time setting up the stack:

1. [Installation](docs/installation.md) for the shared requirements, network setup, and Docker Compose install path.
2. [Home Assistant](docs/home_assistant.md) if you want to install the stack as a Home Assistant add-on instead of Docker Compose.
3. [Cloudflare setup](docs/cloudflare_setup.md) if you want Cloudflare DNS-01 auto-renew for certificates.
4. [Onboarding](docs/onboarding.md) to pair a vacuum from a second machine after the server is running.

Additional docs:

- [Docs index](docs/index.md)
- [Tested vacuums](docs/tested_vacuums.md)
- [Home Assistant](docs/home_assistant.md) for the add-on install path and Home Assistant integration rewiring
- [Using the Roborock App](docs/roborock_app.md)
- [Custom MQTT](docs/custom_mqtt.md)
- [Custom certificate management](docs/custom_cert_management.md)
