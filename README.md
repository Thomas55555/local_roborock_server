Roborock Local Server is a private Roborock HTTPS and MQTT stack you run on your own system.

This service is meant to stay private. Point your own DNS at your server's LAN IP and do **NOT** expose it directly to the public internet. In its current state it does not handle internet exposure safely enough. For now, keep it on your LAN only. In the future, I plan to reuse Roborock's auth natively which should make everything secure enough.

This project is in VERY EARLY BETA!!! Do not use this repository unless you are sure you know what you are doing and are rather technical.

## Requirements

- Docker with `docker compose`
- `uv`
- a Linux server or Linux VM on your LAN
- a domain you control
- a Cloudflare API token with DNS edit access for the zone if you want automatic certificate renewal

## Getting Started

Start here if this is your first time setting up the stack:

1. [Installation](docs/installation.md) for requirements, network setup, configuration, and starting the stack.
2. [Cloudflare setup](docs/cloudflare_setup.md) if you want Cloudflare DNS-01 auto-renew for certificates.
3. [Onboarding](docs/onboarding.md) to pair a vacuum from a second machine after the server is running.
